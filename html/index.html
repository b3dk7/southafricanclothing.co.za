			<h2>my collection</h2>
			<p>below you can see some outfits I have created over time. Initially i wanted to just focus on comfortable trousers (or pants in America) but then after creating my first three quarter trousers influenced by a suggestion of a friendly shopkeeper in a <a href="https://bluesleeve.de/en/">small japanese clothing shop</a> in Hamburg, I figgured it would be best to pair them up with a custom top.</p>

			<h2>about me</h2>
			<p>My interest in making clothes started around 2015 when i decided that my out of the box Edward Scissorhands hands Halloween outfit wasnt realistic enough and i needed to make it better. Recently I have aquired a overlocker (also known as a serger) and sewing machine in order to make and modify clothes at a faster pace. Thinking back, I am no idea why i decided to make girls clothes as seen in the collection above, i guess possibly because a lot of the sewing tutorials I watched on youtube focus on girls clothes. Going forward howerver im motivated to make some boys / unisex clothes.</p>
			<h2>other interests</h2>
			Other than clothes i am also interested in cryptocurrencies. specifically <a href="https://getmonero.org/">monero</a> and <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">bitcoin</a>. Monero is great because its one of the few cryptos that stops you from seeing users balances and transaction history. Bitcoin has the advantage that is due to its large user base it is well tested and robust as it also has the network effect on its side. It would be though to one of these day turn this site into a shop that takes payment in cryptocurrency as opposed to traditional currency.
