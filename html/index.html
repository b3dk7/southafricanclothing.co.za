			<h2>about me</h2>
			<p>My interest in making clothes started around 2015 when i decided that my out of the box edward sizor hands halloween outfit wasnt realistic enough and i needed to make it better. Recently I have aquired a overlocker (also known as a serger) and sewinging machine in order to make and modify clothes at a faster pase. Thinking back, I am no idea why i decided to make girls clothes as seen in the collection above, i guess possibly because a lot of the sewing tutorials I watched on youtube focus on girls clothes. Going forward howerver im motivated to make some boys / unisex clothes.</p>
			<h2>other interests</h2>
			other that clothes i am also interested in cryptocurrencies. specifically monero and bitcoin. Monero is great becaseu its one of the few cryptos that stops you from seeing useres balances and transaction history. Bitcoin has the advantage that is due to its large user base it is well tested and robust it also has the network effect on its side. It would be though to one of these day turn this site into a shop that takes payment in crytop currency as opposed to traditional currency.
